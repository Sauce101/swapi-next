In this project I use Next.js and a Star Wars API to draw from. I use a Star Wars type of feel just for getting ideas on how to mix patterns and thoughts that come to mind. I chose to do the project this way after working with tutorials that used dummy api sites. You can visit this [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) api to see how I brought it to life. Also, I made an English to Galactic Basic dark mode translator on the top left of the site.

Open [SW-API](https://swapi-next.vercel.app/) to view it in your browser.
